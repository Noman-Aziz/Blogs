Documentation is a vital part of any open source project or software, Documentation is the entry point of a fall back option for most users of a software or open source project.


Poor documentation will lead to nothing else but limitation of the reach on an open source peoject,  me as a person, i dont stay long on poor documentaion pages of projects, i will always find an easy and detailed  alternative to such project,.

A nice example of projects that are still finding it hard to keep up with their documentation updates are JQuery, SQLite 

> “If people don’t know why your project exists,
> they won’t use it.
> If people can’t figure out how to install your code,
> they won’t use it.
> If people can’t figure out how to use your code,
> they won’t use it.”
> — Write The Docs

Lets jump in;

1. FInd a project: Projects that you understand

Most of my contributions to open source projects was through the usage of those projects and familiarity of those projects.

So when looking for open source projects, It's better to look into software that you have used or planning to use later,.

The next thing you should do is hit google or github to look for the project, to see how active their repository are and how they handle contributors.

If its cool to you, then you can proceed to see what you want to improve in their documentation or better still to see how you can make life easier for the next person, a very good scenario of this is when I got successful with the deployment of Docusaurus with Firebase


So you see, I use the project and i was able to find something to contribute to.

Also, you can reach out to existing open sourcerer (People who contribute to Open Source)  to ask them which projects are good for new contributors,

You can find some active documentation of open source  projects by alot of organizations here also <a href="https://github.com/saintmalik/awesome-oss-docs"> Awesome OSS Docs </a> which takes and accepts beginners contributions.

You can  find other excellent resources  and <a href="https://jobs.writethedocs.org/">job/Documentation/Writing gigs</a> at the <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs community</a>.

Another  great way of looking for projects is through the use of GitHub’s “Topic” page.

Go to “Explore” and then “Topic”.

Here you will be able to explore alot of topic based projects, there is also a "Documentation" Topic which contains alot of documentation projects.

Once you’ve found a project, you’ll want to keep in mind some basic contribution etiquette as you get started, lets move to thst.

2. Digest the Project guidelines and rules

Now that you have found a great project to contribute to, Before getting ready to contribute, you need to do a little work, which is understanding the Open-Source project contribution guide. 

its always named  ‘CONTRIBUTING.md’, Read this file carefully to learn how to contribute to the project, It typically includes guidelines on what to branch, test, how to format your commit messages and clear step-by-step instructions on how to make a contribution.

Most projects have some prerequisites that you need to follow in order to set up the project properly.

Ask the mainatiners where they need help around their documentations, If you found an issue that you want to tackle, comment about it, and let everyone know that you wish to work on that issue. 

Explain what problem you wish to solve or which new feature you wish to introduce.

Give the maintainers time to respond to it before beginning your work, also remember that many maintainers have day jobs or limited time and may not respond immediately. 

Also many repositories will have an issue template prefilled when you create a new issue. Stick to this template!

When you are done digestting the guides, its time to then look for where on the projects to contribute too.

--  READMEs

Not all open source projects do have a documentation repo or a dedicated documentation folder, some projects always leave their documentation in the README.md file and it is always located at the root of the repository.

The readme file do contain installation guides, how to use guides and in some projects it can be much more than that.

So you can try out the installation guide to see what works and what doesnt work, an example is a Subdomain Recon tool, see their old installation guide, which doesnt work well for others and the update of the new installation guide that works.

You see making a correcting Improvement to the installation guide and instructions will help any new user of the tool.

You can also move on to fixing any Grammar, Spelling and formatting issues you find in the README file.

-- API Documentation

People tends to leave out API Docuementation when they are talking about documentations, you can always contribute to the API documentation of any projects you find intresting and they have an API implementation, you can help improve the documentation.

API Documentation is a technical design document that explains guides developers on how to consume, use and interact with an API, the API Documentation is made up of code snippets, references, methods, tutorials and formating rules

You can also work hand in hand with the backend developer or mainatiner of the project to get guidance on what some API endpont does and so on.

Various contribution opportunities like versioning of the API, so the project maintainers are already working on the V3(version 3) of their API, you can always reach out to them, to see ways to help them with the documentation.

-- Commands, Error Messsage, Code Strings, Language Translation

Here is another nice way of contributing, Error Messages, Code strings and commands, most documentation are formatted in English, and we know, people with other languages might make use of our project, and might find it hard to read the English version of that project documentation.

That creates an opportunity for an individual that understands multile languages to contribute and help translate the documentation into other languages, you can always reach out to the project mainatainer to request for a go ahead.

Erro messages, Code strings are the most important part of a project interface, this is what users see, this messages is what guides users, and give them direction on how to debug issues.

A very poor Error message or code string will give a bad user experience, so picking this up and fixing is also a nice way of contributing.

well, we are done with that, but wait, what if you were given the opportunity to pull up a documentaation project for an open source project that doesn't have one,

That brings us to Documentation Toolkit for those awesome documentation lovers, here are the list of things you will need to get those task done
