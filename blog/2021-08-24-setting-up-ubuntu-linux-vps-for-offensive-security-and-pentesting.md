Having your Linux environment set, is also one of the essentials to getting your assignments done in any pentesting, security class or day to day work.

From where am coming from, have got access to computer with little RAM and power to hold the heavy things I will be putting on it which is virtual box alongside Kali Linux. 

Well I got it installed because I had no options of accessing a Linux environment back then when I started out.

So my computer became so slow ðŸ˜‚, It takes so much time to load up Kali, even after opening it up, I have to click on terminal and chill before it will pop up, I will say it wasn't so easy.

Upon discovering I could set up a running Ubuntu OS in VPS, that's when i stopped using Kali Linux, this doesn't mean Kali Linux isn't good.

So today i will be guiding you on how to set up your own Ubuntu OS on VPS for Pentesting activities and Offensive Security.

Let's get started;

We have alot of VPS service providers;

1. Digital Ocean
2. Linode
3. Microsoft Azure
4. Amazon AWS
5. Vultr


I use Digital Ocean though, you can signup for Digital Ocean [here](https://m.do.co/c/96387f0a5b7e) (You will need to add your credit card or paypal to get free $100 Digital Ocean credit) after signing up.

When you are done signing up, Navigate to your dashboard.

Locate the **Create** button at the top left hand side of your dashboard, click on it to list out things that can be created, then select **Droplet**

![Create Ubuntu Linux VPS Droplet](https://github.com/saintmalik/blog.saintmalik.me/blob/main/blog/images/droplet.webp)

The Droplets dashboard will open up, where we would set up every thing, on the Droplets Dashboard under **Choose an image** you will see things Distributiions like Ubuntu, Debain, Cent OS, Fedora, You can pick any distribution you like, but here we will be picking Ubuntu.

Also if you have any other Linux Distribution images you like, you can also upload them using the **Custom images** option under the **Choose an image Settings**
