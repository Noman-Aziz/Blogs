Having your Linux environment set, is also one of the essentials to getting your assignments done in any pentesting, security class or day to day work.

From where am coming from, have got access to computer with little RAM and power to hold the heavy things I will be putting on it which is virtual box alongside Kali Linux, well I got it installed because I had no options of accessing a Linux environment back then when I started out.

So my computer became so slow ðŸ˜‚, It takes so much time to load up Kali to login using the root:root credentials, even after opening it up, I have to click on terminal and chill before it will pop up, I will say it wasn't so easy.
