Having your Linux environment set, is also one of the essentials to getting your assignments done in any pentesting, security class or day to day work.
<!--truncate-->

From where am coming from, have got access to computer with little RAM and power to hold the heavy things I will be putting on it which is virtual box alongside Kali Linux. 

Well I got it installed because I had no options of accessing a Linux environment back then when I started out.

So my computer became so slow ðŸ˜‚, It takes so much time to load up Kali, even after opening it up, I have to click on terminal and chill before it will pop up, I will say it wasn't so easy.

Upon discovering I could set up a running Ubuntu OS in VPS, that's when i stopped using Kali Linux, this doesn't mean Kali Linux isn't good.

So today i will be guiding you on how to set up your own Ubuntu OS on VPS for Pentesting activities and Offensive Security.

Let's get started;

## Creating and Setting up your Ubuntu Linux VPS

We have alot of VPS service providers;

1. Digital Ocean
2. Linode
3. Microsoft Azure
4. Amazon AWS
5. Vultr


I use Digital Ocean though, you can signup for Digital Ocean [here](https://m.do.co/c/96387f0a5b7e) (You will need to add your credit card or paypal to get free $100 Digital Ocean credit) after signing up.

When you are done signing up, Navigate to your dashboard.

Locate the **Create** button at the top left hand side of your dashboard, click on it to list out things that can be created, then select **Droplet**

  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/droplet.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/droplet.jpg"/>
</picture>

The Droplets dashboard will open up, where we would set up every thing, on the Droplets Dashboard under **Choose an image** you will see things Distributiions like Ubuntu, Debain, Cent OS, Fedora.

  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/droplet-settings-vps.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/droplet-settings-vps.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/droplet-settings-vps.jpg"/>
</picture>

You can pick any distribution you like, but here we will be picking Ubuntu.

Also if you have any other Linux Distribution images you like, you can also upload them using the **Custom images** option under the **Choose an image Settings**

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/distribution-image-vps.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/distribution-image-vps.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/distribution-image-vps.jpg"/>
</picture>

Back to our settings;

After choosing **Ubuntu**  or any other Distribution you like under  the **Choose an image** settings, 

Lets proceed to the next setting **Choose a plan** 

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/choose-plan-linux-vps-ubuntu.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/choose-plan-linux-vps-ubuntu.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/choose-plan-linux-vps-ubuntu.jpg"/>
</picture>

I will be leaving the option to Basic, under the **CPU options:** you can decide which CPU Option you like, but am poicking **Premium Intel with NVMe SSD**  

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/cpu-options-linux-vps-servers.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/cpu-options-linux-vps-servers.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/cpu-options-linux-vps-servers.jpg"/>
</picture>

After that  we will choose $6/month plan which as 1 GB / 1 Intel CPU, 25 GB  NVMe SSD disk, 1000 GB transfer 

Note: The reason why am picking this option is bacause i wont be doing an heavy activities or run tools that can eat up that space i have choosen.

So you can decide to pick any plan, based on what you want, and based on the credit you have in your Digitalocean account.

The more CPU and SSD disk space you choose the faster your environment will be.

Moving to the **Add block storage**  

Leave this settings to default,.

For the **Choose a datacenter region** Settings

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/datacenter-linux-vps-ubuntu.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/datacenter-linux-vps-ubuntu.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/datacenter-linux-vps-ubuntu.jpg"/>
</picture>

You can choose any data centre near to your location or closer to your region.

**VPC Network Settings** 

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/vpc-network-ubuntu-vps-linux.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/vpc-network-ubuntu-vps-linux.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/vpc-network-ubuntu-vps-linux.jpg"/>
</picture>

You can leave this to default also.

**Select additional options Settings** 

You can decide what to do here, for me I prefer to enabling IPv6 option only, in other to access the IPv4 and 6.

  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-vps-linux.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-vps-linux.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/ubuntu-vps-linux.jpg"/>
</picture>

Coming to the **Authentication Settings** 

We can choose the _Password_ option , looks easy to me, so now let's enter our password.

This passoword is what we will be using to login into our Ubuntu VPS

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/authentication-linux-vps-server.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/authentication-linux-vps-server.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/authentication-linux-vps-server.jpg"/>
</picture>

Make sure its a password you can remember because thatâ€™s what you will be using to log into your root user on your VPS.

Moving to the **Finalize and create Settings**

Here you can rename your host name to anything you like, i changed mine to _offensive-security_

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/finalize-and-create-droplet-vps-pentesting.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/finalize-and-create-droplet-vps-pentesting.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/finalize-and-create-droplet-vps-pentesting.jpg"/>
</picture>

For the **Add tags**,  you can skip it, it has no effect

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/create-ubuntu-droplet.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/create-ubuntu-droplet.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/create-ubuntu-droplet.jpg"/>
</picture>

Finally hit the **Create Droplet** button and your main dashboard should look like this

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-droplet-look-dashboard.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-droplet-look-dashboard.jpg"/>

## How to Connect into your Ubuntu Linux VPS from Any Terminal

Heres how you can access your ubuntu VPS Server from any Terminal, be it Mac default Terminal, Even from your Kali Terminal, Termux or any other linux terminal.    

Type the command 

```bash
ssh root@IP_Adrress_Of_Your_Droplet
```
You find the **IP_Adrress_Of_Your_Droplet** on your droplet dashboard

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-droplet-look-dashboard.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-droplet-look-dashboard.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/ubuntu-droplet-look-dashboard.jpg"/>
</picture>

Copy that IPv4, that's your Droplet IP addrress, your command then will look likw this.

```
ssh root@143.244.155.170
```
after running this command you wil be prompted to enter Yes/No, enter yes to proceed, then you will be asked to enter your server password.

  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/ssh-prompt-ubuntu-droplet.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/ssh-prompt-ubuntu-droplet.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/ssh-prompt-ubuntu-droplet.jpg"/>
</picture>

Your password is the password you entered while creating your Ubuntu VPS, after entering your password you will access your Ubuntu VPS now and your screen should look like this.

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-linux-vps-offensive-security.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/ubuntu-linux-vps-offensive-security.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/ubuntu-linux-vps-offensive-security.jpg"/>
</picture>

Then run this command to update and upgarde packages in your Ubuntu VPS

```
apt update && apt upgrade
```

Thats all.

You can also choose to go further by creating a user, instead of doing everything using the root user

To create a suer on your Ubuntu VPS, run this command

```
adduser YOURNAME
```
e.g 

```
adduser saintmalik
```

You will be prompted to enter the user password and some informations, you can skip the information part by just hitting the ENTER button.

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/adduser-linux-ubuntu-vps.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/adduser-linux-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/adduser-linux-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
</picture>

You can also confirm if the user has been created using this command

```
tail -5 /etc/passwd
```

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/listusers-ubuntu-vps.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/listusers-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/listusers-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
</picture>

If we have confirmed that the user is created, we can then go ahead to add the user to the sudo group using this command.

```
usermod -aG sudo USER
```
replace USER with the name of the user you created.

Now that we have created a new user called "Saintmalik" , we can then go ahead to connect into our Ubuntu VPS using this command

```bash
ssh saintmalik@IP_Adrress_Of_Your_Droplet
```

You wil replace the _IP_Adrress_Of_Your_Droplet_ to your Ubuntu IP address just like this

```
ssh saintmalik@143.244.155.170
```
You will be asked to enter your password, this time around the password you will be using is the password you used while createing the user "saintmalik"

<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/bgimg/linux-newuser-ubuntu-vps.webp"/>
  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/bgimg/linux-newuser-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
  <img src="/bgimg/linux-newuser-ubuntu-vps.jpg"/>
</picture>

You are good to go now. 

## How to Connect into your Ubuntu Linux VPS from Windows System

Window buddies, i know you have powershell, but it stressfulll if you try to run  some linux command and you get that error of `command doesn't exit`.

So now we need to connect to our created Ubuntu Linux VPS, we cant use powershell.

You can use Putty.exe â€“ https://www.putty.org/  to ssh/connect into the our created ubuntu VPS.

Also we can use Windows Subsystem for Linux, go to Microsoft Store under the Developer tools Utilities category and search for [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?cid=msft_web_chart&activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

When it installs fully and you have a terminal opened up on your screen, follow the process weve explained above.
