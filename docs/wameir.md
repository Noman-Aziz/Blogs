title: Wameir - 
---

Language used: Golang ðŸ˜Œ

Wameir was built out of repeated task that is common with Community builders or any individual that takes users WhatApp details via either through forms or survey.

Well, after taking users WhatsApp numbers, here come the stressful task of either saving their numbers individually to message them or drop them the community link or manually adding wa.me/NUMBER everytime.

This action can be stressful and also saving numbers unneccasrily can be bad for ones privacy.

You surely dont want the users seeing your status but to join the community or whatsoever you want them to do.

Here comes the time saver and the stress reducer WAMEIR ðŸ˜‚

All you have to do is select the country that the number belongs to and paste those bulky WhatsApp numbers and hit submit.
