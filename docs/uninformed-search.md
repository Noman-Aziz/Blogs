# Uninformed Search: Learning about Search Algorithms[BFS,DFS(DLS,IDS)]

Uninformed search refers to the search algorithm that has no additional details aside the details provided in the problem defined.

It is just like a child being told to go to the kitchen to bring a white place from the plate rack, on gettting to the kitchen, he couldnt find the white plate in the rack, whereas the white is also in the kitchen but it is not inside the plate rack but on the floor beside the plate rack.

So the child would come back telling his/her parent that he couldn't find the white plate.

The child wasn't provided with enough information to to look fo the white plate.
