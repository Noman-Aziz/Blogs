title: How to use Pentesting VPS with ease via VsCode SSH Extension
---

Am a big fan of using VPS as my workspace (pentesting/development/and basic tasks) and have been using it for a long period of time now,.

If you dont know how to setup a VPS for Pentesting or Development sake, feel free to check this step by step guide on Setting Up Ubuntu Linux VPS For Offensive Security and Pentesting

Everything with an advantage will also have a disadvantage, and some of the disadavantages of using a VPS as a workspace are;

1. The movement of files from my local system to my VPS, vice versa
2. Spinning up nano everytime to write and searching through files for a pattern and all that and more.

Although i do find my way around this issues via Terminal, but having a nice way to access this thing can be helpful and speed up work rate.

That brings us to the VSCode Software and its awesome Extention named <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh"> Remote -SSh  </a>

With this you can access your VPS environment through a nice Interface good for navigation, can be handing when doing Android App Pentest where you decompile Apks and grep through th files or looking through manually.

Creating files and editing files easily, so when you are done with installation, here is how to get your things up and running.
